E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard
This repository contains data extracted from an E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard, originally in Excel format. It provides various datasets to understand sales performance, key metrics, and geographical distribution of e-commerce activities.

Project Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce sales data, breaking down performance by various metrics, including Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), year-over-year growth, regional sales, and top-performing products/categories. The data is presented in a structured way, enabling quick insights and further analytical exploration.

Files Included
The following CSV files have been extracted from the original Excel dashboard, each serving a specific analytical purpose:

This file contains the primary transactional data for the e-commerce sales. It's the foundational dataset for most analyses.

Data specifically prepared for a combo chart, likely combining different metrics (e.g., sales and profit over time).

Waterfall Chart: Contains data structured for a waterfall chart, useful for visualizing the cumulative effect of sequential additions or subtractions from a starting value (e.g., profit breakdown).

Pie Chart: Data formatted for a pie chart, typically used to show proportions or market share of different categories (e.g., sales by product category).

Map Chart: Geographic sales data, suitable for visualization on a map to show regional performance.

Top 5: Presents data for the top 5 entities, which could be top products, customers, regions, or categories by sales or profit.

KPI: Contains Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, order count, etc., providing an overall snapshot of performance.

KPI YOY: Year-over-Year (YOY) data for key performance indicators, allowing for comparison of current performance against previous periods to identify trends and growth.

layout: This file likely describes the layout or structure of the original dashboard, which might be useful for recreating or understanding the dashboard's design.

Purpose of the Analysis
The extracted data supports various analyses, including:

Sales Performance Tracking: Monitor overall sales, profit, and order volumes.

Trend Analysis: Identify sales trends over time using the combo and YOY KPI data.

Profitability Insights: Understand the components contributing to overall profit through the waterfall chart data.

Geographical Analysis: Visualize sales distribution across different regions using map data.

Top Performer Identification: Pinpoint the best-performing products, categories, or customers.

KPI Monitoring: Keep track of crucial business metrics and their year-over-year changes.
